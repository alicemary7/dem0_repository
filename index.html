    <h1>Code Learning</h1>
    <p>In the context of computers, code refers to a set of instructions written in a specific programming language that a computer can understand and execute to perform tasks. It's essentially a way for humans to communicate with machines, providing them with the steps needed to achieve a desired outcome. </p>

      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language, not
        a programming language, used to define the structure and content of web
        pages.

      <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
      <p>JavaScript, a "paragraph" often refers to an HTML
        element that is manipulated or created using JavaScript. JavaScript
        provides methods to dynamically create, modify, and add paragraph
        elements to a webpage's Document Object Model (DOM).

      <h4>CASCADING STYLE SHEETS</h4>
      <p>
        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to
        describe the presentation of a web page, including colors, layout, and
        fonts. It works in conjunction with HTML, which provides the structure
        and content of a web page, while CSS dictates how that content is
        visually displayed.
